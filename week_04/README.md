# Week 4


### Overview

On Tuesday this week, we discussed storytelling with data. A couple of concepts stuck out to me, including the notion of thinking like a journalist when looking for and creating a story with data. This wasn't a particularly new way of thinking for me, as I had worked in economics journalism before enrolling at Harris. However, it was a good reminder to tap into that past experience and use it when building data visualizations. I also very much enjoyed the "Visualizations That Really Work" article, and the four basic categories of data visualozations that emerge when thinking about the following: 1) is the purpose of the visualization declarative or exploratory, and 2) is the visualization conceptual or data driven? This structure of thinking about data visualizations spanned sectors and industries, in addition to allowing for several artistic/design liberties. 
Essentially, it is a structured and useful way of thinking about data visualizations without being as rigid as Edward Tufte or Stephen Few's philosophies. We also learned how to build a horizontal bar chart is d3.

On Thursday in class, we learned how to build a line graph, area graph, and multi-line graph in d3. For homework, we practiced building a line graph.
