# CAPP30239_FA22 [Insert project title here]

## Introduction/Project Description
This repository contains the code and any accompanying files used to complete my project in Data Visualization for Policy Analysis (CAPP30239 Autumn 2022, University of Chicago).

This project will tell a story, through data visualizations, about a particular policy topic (TBD). 
Potential topics include something within my expertise of economic development, international relations, and/or gender equality.

This project will largely utilize html, css, and javascript - in particular d3.js.
