# Liz Colavita

My name is Liz Colavita, and I am a second-year CAPP student. I chose Harris/CAPP following an internship experience with the UN in which I saw first-hand the lack of understanding between data scientists and policy makers. 
Organizations, particularly government, NGO, and multilateral organizations, are increasingly commissioning research and quantitative data collection with limited capabilities to effectively interpret that data and implement actionable insights. 
 enrolled in this course because I see the value of data visualizations to help bridge this gap and to communicate actionable insights from data.
I am particularly interested in how this intersects with program/policy evaluation.
Prior to attending University of Chicago, I was based out of Istanbul for about 4 years working in economics and business journalism, which is another area where data visualization is extremely applicable.
Though Istanbul was my home base, I spent significant time in Jordan and Dubai. 
I love to travel. My newest hobby is rock climbing, and I'm hoping to start alto saxophone lessons in the the near future!
