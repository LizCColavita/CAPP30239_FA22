# Week 2

In this read me document I summarize my reflections on the week as well as present my Dear Data project.

### Data Humanism

As data and our interactions with data becomes more ubiquitous, we need to emphasize that our interactions are more unique, intimate, complex, contextual. This can include utilizing, creating, and interacting with visualizations that have high density of data and multiple attributes. Essentially, we are moving away from the more minimalist, reductionist trends that have dominated data visualization 1.0.

I really loved what Giorgia Lupi said in their keynote speech about the potential for data to be the foundation for human connection and visualizations to be solutions to bring people closer together. This is a beautiful, poetic, and optimistic way of viewing humans and data as not inherently opposed but intertwined. So often we think of our humanity and data as diametrically opposed. Conventional narratives say that humans are messy, flawed, and emotional; data is sterile, rational, and scientific. But this currently widely held viewpoint doesn't sit well with me. Data is just as messy as we are, and it is in this complexity maybe we build connections and find solutions.


### DEAR DATA PROJECT

In creating my own Dear Data postcard, I recorded the number of times and the context in which I danced in the 5 days spanning Wednesday Oct 5 - Sunday October 9. 

It could be as subtle as swaying and moving my shoulders while sitting at my desk working, or it could be dancing down a sidewalk in River North on when I heard a banger on the way to my birthday dinner. Sometimes I danced in the morning getting ready or making breakfast; sometimes I was waiting for the L or the Metra doing a little dance on the platform. These little moments of movement always bring me joy, and it was especially fun to more intentionally notice and appreciate them.

From observing when I danced, I learned that I like to dance most mornings. And further reflecting on this habit has helped me realize that I do some of my best work and thinking in the mornings. As evidenced by my reflections through this assignment, sitting with more contextualized, complex data can lead to more insights. 

I am also more comfortable dancing in the confines and comfort of my own apartment, but if the mood is right, I will dance in public. I'm break dancing on the train platform or waltzing through downtown, but I will move my body while listening to music in these more mundane moments.

Following this exercise in data humanism, I would love to learn more types of dance and continue finding ways to dance with others. Dance is very much aligned with data humanism in that it is meant to bring us together. It is meant to make us more human.

As a student of both data science and public policy, I very much appreciated this unit on data humanism. Though I won't be creating Dear Data postcards to influence policy, this reminder that there is always a human behind a data point. Relationships between data points more often than not reflect relationships between humans and more broadly our humanity. Remembering to look at data through this lens often is good practice for remembering the humans behind the policy or impact we are trying to influence as policy and data practitioners. Humans, relationships, and the issues we are trying to solve are highly complex, so our data visualizations can (should?) represent some of this complexity and context.
