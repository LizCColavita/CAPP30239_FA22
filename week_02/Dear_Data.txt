DEAR DATA PROJECT

In creating my own Dear Data postcard, I recorded the number of times and the context in which I danced in the 5 days spanning Wednesday Oct 5 - Sunday October 9. 

It could be as subtle as swaying and moving my shoulders while sitting at my desk working, or it could be dancing down a sidewalk in River North on when I heard a banger on the way to my birthday dinner. Sometimes I danced in the morning getting ready or making breakfast; sometimes I was waiting for the L or the Metra doing a little dance on the platform. These little moments of movement always bring me joy, and it was especially fun to more intentionally notice and appreciate them.

From observing when I danced, I learned that I like to dance most mornings. And further reflecting on this habit has helped me realize that I do some of my best work and thinking in the mornings.

I am also more comfortable dancing in the confines and comfort of my own apartment, but if the mood is right, I will dance in public. I'm break dancing on the train platform or waltzing through downtown, but I will move my body while listening to music in these more mundane moments.

Following this exercise in data humanism, I would love to learn more types of dance and continue finding ways to dance with others. Dance is very much aligned with data humanism in that it is meant to bring us together. It is meant to make us more human.

As a student of both data science and public policy, I very much appreciated this unit on data humanism. Though I won't be creating Dear Data postcards to influence policy, this reminder that there is always a human behind a data point. Relationships between data points more often than not reflect relationships between humans and more broadly our humanity. Remembering to look at data through this lens often is good practice for remembering the humans behind of policy or impact we are trying to influence as policy and data practitioners.
