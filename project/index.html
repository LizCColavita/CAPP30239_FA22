            Women are making headlines in sports at both national and international levels, from professional leagues to collegiate athletics. 
            Just this week, Julianne Sitch, head coach of the University of Chicago men's soccer team, is the

            And we best not forget that professional sports are big businesses. From the field to the boardroom, women are making moves. 
            With its long history in the US and its moniker as “Americas pastime,” we see women trailblazing in the sport of baseball as 
            far back as the late 1800s. In 1898, Lizzie Arlington was the 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_women%27s_sports"> first woman to sign a professional baseball contract</a> 
            as a pitcher with the Philadelphia Reserves. Eleven years after the turn of the century, 
            <a href="https://medium.com/sportsraid/helene-hathaway-robison-britton-the-first-woman-to-own-a-major-league-baseball-team-23d175bb7ff2">
            Helene Hathaway Robison-Britton inherited the St. Louis Cardinals</a> from her father, becoming the first woman to own a major league baseball team.
            After a battle for a controlling stake in the Los Angeles Lakers amongst the children of former owner Dr. Jerry Buss, 
            Jeanie Buss inherited controlling ownership in 2017 and in 2020 became the first woman owner in professional sports to 
            <a href="https://www.lamag.com/culturefiles/jeanie-buss-lakers-owner/">win a championship under her watch</a>.

        <p>
            Data from <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/sports-political-donations">FiveThirtyEight</a> outlines the political campaign donations of owners and commissioners in six sports leagues, 
            namely the MLB, NBA, NHL, NFL, WNBA, and NASCAR, in the 2016, 2018, and 2020 elections. By and large, donations are to 
            Republican-affiliated campaigns, and donations have dropped off in the four years between the 2016 and 2020 presidential 
            elections. These trends hold across league and across the gender of the owner, with a few exceptions.
        </p>

        <p>
            Hidden within these averages and aggregations are some exceptions in the <b>MLB, WNBA, and NFL</b>.

            <h2>Nearly Half of all NFL Owners are Women</h2>
    
            <p>
                Of the owners included in FiveThirtyEight's dataset, nearly 16%, or 1 in 6 owners, are women. Encouragingly, 
                the proportion of women owners is proportional to their political campaign donations, that is women owners account for 
                just over 17% of political campaign donation in the dataset.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, there are large disparities across leagues. Notably, women owners in the NFL are skewing the aggregate proportion 
                of women sports team owners. Women account for 46% of owners in the NFL. The WNBA is the league with the second-highest 
                proportion of women owners with over 17%. On the other end of the spectrum are the MLB with nearly 5% women owners, and 
                NASCAR with no women owners.
