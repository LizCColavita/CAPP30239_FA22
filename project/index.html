        <p>
            Campaign donations of professional sports team owners generally lean toward the right of the political spectrum, 
            and by and largely, have decreased significantly between the 2016 and 2020 elections. In aggregation, these trends hold across leagues and across 
            gender of the owner. Looking at all leagues combined, women owners actually skew more to the right than their male counterparts. 
            However, these averages and aggregations hide some anomalies.
