            Women are making headlines in sports at both national and international levels, from professional leagues to collegiate athletics. 
            Just this week, Julianne Sitch, head coach of the University of Chicago men's soccer team, is the 
            <a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/story/uchicago-mens-soccer-team-wins-ncaa-division-iii-championship">first woman to lead a men's soccer 
            team to the NCAA championship title</a> - the program's first title ever and all within her first year in the position no less.  On the world stage, Stéphanie Frappart will lead the 
            <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/01/sports/soccer/world-cup-women-referee-crew.html"> first all-women referee team at a World Cup.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            And we best not forget that professional sports are big businesses. From the field to the boardroom, women are making moves. 
            With its long history in the US and its moniker as “America's pastime,” we see women trailblazing in baseball as 
            far back as the late 1800s. In 1898, Lizzie Arlington was the 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_women%27s_sports"> first woman to sign a professional baseball contract</a> 
            as a pitcher with the Philadelphia Reserves. Eleven years after the turn of the century, 
            <a href="https://medium.com/sportsraid/helene-hathaway-robison-britton-the-first-woman-to-own-a-major-league-baseball-team-23d175bb7ff2">
            Helene Hathaway Robison-Britton inherited the St. Louis Cardinals</a> from her father, becoming the first woman to own a major league baseball team.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over a century later, after a battle for a controlling stake in the Los Angeles Lakers amongst the children of former owner Dr. Jerry Buss, 
            Jeanie Buss inherited controlling ownership in 2017 and in 2020 became the first woman owner in professional sports to 
            <a href="https://www.lamag.com/culturefiles/jeanie-buss-lakers-owner/">win a championship under her watch</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Data from <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/sports-political-donations">FiveThirtyEight</a> outlines the political campaign donations of owners and commissioners in six sports leagues, 
            namely the MLB, NBA, NHL, NFL, WNBA, and NASCAR, in the 2016, 2018, and 2020 elections. By and large, donations are to 
            Republican-affiliated campaigns, and donations have dropped off in the four years between the 2016 and 2020 presidential 
            elections. These trends hold across league and across the gender of the owner, with a few exceptions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hidden within these averages and aggregations are some anomalies in the <b>MLB, WNBA, and NFL</b>.
        </p>  
        <div>
            <h2>Women MLB Owners and Men WNBA Owners Donate More to Democrat-Affiliated Campaigns</h2>
            <div id="grouped-bar"></div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Owners of MLB teams comprise over 46% of political campaigns donations at $21.68 million. This is nearly double the political
                    contributions of the runner-up league in terms of donations, which is the NBA at $12.03 million. In comparison with the 
                    five other sports leagues in this dataset, the sheer size of MLB owner's political donations is of particular interest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yet, a deeper dive reveals a complete divergence from the normal donating patterns across most leagues, even when 
                    accounting for the gender of the team owner. <b>Of Women MLB owners' political donations, 97% went to Democrat-affiliated campaigns.</b>
                    This is in contrast with all women owners across leagues wherein 32% of donations went to Democratic campaigns. The difference 
                    becomes even more stark when looking at all men owners' donations, of which 20% of donations went to Democratic coffers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though MLB team owners overall account for a significant portion of sports owners' political contributions, women owners 
                    only account for 8% of donations in the league. Moreover, if one were to break down donations by league and gender of the owner into 11 categories 
                    (two genders across six leagues, with the the exception of NASCAR which has no women owners), women MLB owners come in 7th totaling 
                    $1.77 million in campaign donations. Unsurprisingly, their men counterparts rank first at $19.9 million.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Figuring out why women MLB owners' donation patterns deviate so strongly from the norm is beyond the scope of this dataset and 
                    not readily explained upon further investigation of the MLB fanbase. Figures from a <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1174866/political-affiliation-mlb-fans/">2020 survey of MLB fans</a> 
                    shows that on average, 38% of MLB fans identify as Democrats. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kirkwakefield/2021/04/05/major-league-baseball-at-odds-with-itself-and-its-fans/?sh=740bb5d55357">Further analysis</a> 
                    reveals a deep split amongst MLB fans regarding the MLB's decision to move the 2021 All-Star Game from Atlanta, GA 
                    following legislation that restricted voting rights of marginalized groups. MLB's more traditional fanbase - more conservative Boomers 
                    and Gen X fans - views are quite different from Millennial fans. Millennial fans, regardless of political ideology, were more likely to view
                    the move for the 2021 All-Star Game more positively. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nor do donations or rhetoric from the League Commissioner Robert Manfred indicate a noteworthy liberal bend. Manfred 
                    was quoted in <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/31183822/mlb-moving-all-star-game-atlanta-georgia-voting-law"> an ESPN article</a> 
                    after the All-Star Game relocation announcement, "In 2020, MLB became the first professional sports league to join 
                    the non-partisan Civic Alliance to help build a future in which everyone participates in shaping the United States." A non-partisan 
                    campaign for democratic participation is not particularly radical. Furthermore, Manfred's political contributions, albeit incredibly 
                    small totaling $5200, went to Republican-affiliated campaigns in 2016 and 2018.
                </p> 
                <p> 
                    Overall, fans are not incredibly left-leaning, despite perhaps a growing schism in the fanbase. The commissioner has publicly supported voting access and 
                    a participatory democracy. This all does very little to explain the overwhelming propensity for women owners to donate to 
                    Democrat-affiliated political campaigns.
                </p>   
                <p>
                    Perhaps intuitively, the WNBA is the only league in which donations to Democratic campaigns outpace donations to Republican campaigns. 
                    52% of WNBA owners donations went to Democrat-affiliated campaigns. For comparison, 22.8% of donations across leagues went to Democratic 
                    recipients. Interestingly, it was <b>men owners in the WNBA driving the leftward lean of the league's political donations</b>.

            <div>
                <p>
                    Dissecting the WNBA numbers by gender, men owners' contributions comprise 68% of all donations from WNBA owners, and 72% of their political dollars went to Democratic campaigns. 
                    Of the 32% of WNBA donations that were made by women owners, nearly 90% went to Republican campaigns - the highest percentage of women owners' contributions to 
                    Republican campaigns across leagues that have women owners.

                    The bubble charts below summarize the donation patterns of men and women owners. The bubble represent the total donations to 
                    a particular party affiliation in each league, whereby size represents the donation amount and color represents the party affiliation of 
                    the donations. For example, the largest bubble in the first chart represents men MLB owners' donations to Republican-affiliated campaigns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Looking at men's donation patterns, the three largest donation amounts are MLB, NBA, and NHL owners' contributions to Republican affiliated
                    campaigns. Rounding out the top five are MLB and NBA donations to Democrat-affiliated campaigns.

            <div>
                <p>
                    Women's donations are overall much smaller than men's, but it is notable that women MLB owners' political contributions to
                    Democrat-affiliated campaigns represent the second-largest category of women's donations. And though women owners' donations are 
                    considerably smaller than men's in absolute value, in aggregation their ratio as owners is on par with their ratio of donated campaign dollars,
                    hovering at approximately 16% (25 women out of 158 owners) and 15% ($6.9 million out of $47 million), respectively.

            <h2>Women Account for 58% of all NFL Political Contributions...but are only 30% of Owners</h2>
            <p>
                Arguably, the NFL is the most visible example of women joining the playing field. In 2021, Sarah Thomas garnered attention 
                as the <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/sarah-thomas-first-woman-to-referee-the-super-bowl">first woman referee to work a Super Bowl game</a>, 
                having previously broken barriers as the first woman to referee a major college football game, a college bowl game. In her 
                pattern of firsts, she was first full-time woman hire in the NFL, and in 2019, she refereed an NFL playoff game.

            <p>
                Of the owners included in FiveThirtyEight's dataset, nearly 16%, or 1 in 6 owners, are women. Encouragingly, 
                the proportion of women owners is proportional to their political campaign donations, that is women owners account for 
                just over 17% of political campaign donation in the dataset in aggregate. Breaking down these figures by league, however, 
                we see that women owners in the NFL are relatively big political spenders. They make up 30% of owners in the NFL, yet they account for 
                nearly double that figure in terms of NFL political donations.

            <p>
                Moreover, women owners in the  WNBA and NFL are skewing the aggregate proportion of women sports team owners. Women account 
                for 35% of owners in the WNBA and 29% in the NFL. On the other end of the spectrum are the NHL and NBA with 13%  and 8% women owners, respectively.
