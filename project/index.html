            Women are making headlines in sports at both national and international levels, from professional leagues to collegiate athletics. 
            Just this week, Julianne Sitch, head coach of the University of Chicago men's soccer team, became the 
            <a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/story/uchicago-mens-soccer-team-wins-ncaa-division-iii-championship">first woman to lead a men's soccer 
            team to the NCAA championship title</a> - the program's first-ever title and all within her first year in the position no less.  On the world stage, Stéphanie Frappart led the 
            <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/01/sports/soccer/world-cup-women-referee-crew.html"> first all-women referee team at a World Cup.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            And we best not forget that professional sports are big businesses. From the field to the boardroom, women are making moves. 
            With its long history in the US and its moniker as “America's pastime,” we see women trailblazing in baseball as 
            far back as the late 1800s. In 1898, Lizzie Arlington was the 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_women%27s_sports"> first woman to sign a professional baseball contract</a> 
            as a pitcher with the Philadelphia Reserves. Eleven years after the turn of the century, 
            <a href="https://medium.com/sportsraid/helene-hathaway-robison-britton-the-first-woman-to-own-a-major-league-baseball-team-23d175bb7ff2">
            Helene Hathaway Robison-Britton inherited the St. Louis Cardinals</a> from her father, becoming the first woman to own a major league baseball team.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over a century later, after a battle for a controlling stake in the Los Angeles Lakers amongst the children of former owner Dr. Jerry Buss, 
            Jeanie Buss inherited controlling ownership in 2017 and in 2020 became the first woman owner in professional sports to 
            <a href="https://www.lamag.com/culturefiles/jeanie-buss-lakers-owner/">win a championship under her watch</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Data from <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/sports-political-donations">FiveThirtyEight</a> outlines the political campaign donations of owners and commissioners in six sports leagues, 
            namely the MLB, NBA, NHL, NFL, WNBA, and NASCAR, in the 2016, 2018, and 2020 elections. By and large, donations are to 
            Republican-affiliated campaigns, and donations have dropped off in the four years between the 2016 and 2020 presidential 
            elections. These trends hold across league and across gender of owners, with a few exceptions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hidden within these averages and aggregations are some anomalies in the <b>MLB, WNBA, and NFL</b>, though the explanation for these pattern-breakers
            is not always clear.
        </p>  
        <div>
            <h2>Women MLB Owners and Men WNBA Owners Donate More to Democrat-Affiliated Campaigns</h2>
            <div id="grouped-bar"></div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Owners of MLB teams comprise over 46% of political campaigns donations, at $21.68 million. This is nearly double the political
                    contributions of the runner-up league in terms of donations, which is the NBA's $12.03 million. In comparison with the 
                    five other sports leagues in this dataset, the sheer size of MLB owners' political donations is of particular interest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yet, a deeper dive reveals a complete divergence from the normal donating patterns across most leagues. <b>Of Women MLB owners' political donations, 97% went to Democrat-affiliated campaigns.</b>
                    This is in contrast with all women owners across leagues whereby 32% of donations went to Democratic campaigns. The difference 
                    becomes even more stark when looking at all men owners' donations, of which 20% went to Democratic coffers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though MLB team owners overall account for a significant portion of sports owners' political contributions, women owners 
                    only account for 8% of donations in the league. Moreover, if one were to break down donations by league and gender of the owner into 11 categories 
                    (two genders across six leagues, with the the exception of NASCAR which has no women owners), women MLB owners come in 7th totaling 
                    $1.77 million in campaign donations. Unsurprisingly, their men counterparts rank first at $19.9 million.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Figuring out why women MLB owners' donation patterns deviate so strongly from the norm is beyond the scope of this dataset and 
                    not readily explained upon further investigation of the MLB fanbase. Figures from a <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1174866/political-affiliation-mlb-fans/">2020 survey of MLB fans</a> 
                    show that on average, 38% of MLB fans identify as Democrats. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kirkwakefield/2021/04/05/major-league-baseball-at-odds-with-itself-and-its-fans/?sh=740bb5d55357">Further analysis</a> 
                    reveals a deep split amongst MLB fans regarding the MLB's decision to move the 2021 All-Star Game from Atlanta, GA 
                    following legislation that restricted voting rights of marginalized groups. MLB's more traditional fanbase - more conservative Boomers 
                    and Gen X fans - views are quite different from Millennial fans. Millennial fans, regardless of political ideology, were more likely to view
                    the move for the 2021 All-Star Game more positively. Nonetheless, this is hardly evidence of a bottom-up influence on owners' political donations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nor do donations or rhetoric from the league commissioner Robert Manfred indicate a noteworthy liberal bend that would cause top-down influence 
                    within the league. Manfred was quoted in <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/31183822/mlb-moving-all-star-game-atlanta-georgia-voting-law"> an ESPN article</a> 
                    after the All-Star Game relocation announcement, "In 2020, MLB became the first professional sports league to join 
                    the non-partisan Civic Alliance to help build a future in which everyone participates in shaping the United States." A non-partisan 
                    campaign for democratic participation is not particularly radical. Furthermore, Manfred's political contributions, albeit incredibly 
                    small totaling $5200, went to Republican-affiliated campaigns in 2016 and 2018.
                </p> 
                <p> 
                    Overall, fans are not incredibly left-leaning, despite perhaps a growing schism in the fanbase. The commissioner has publicly supported voting access and 
                    a participatory democracy, yet donated to Republican campaigns. This all does very little to explain the staggering propensity for women owners to donate to 
                    Democrat-affiliated political campaigns.
                </p>   
                <p>
                    While MLB women owners are overwhelmingly left-leaning in their political donations, this has little bearing on overall MLB owners' donations. 
                    In contrast, the <b>WNBA is the only league in which donations to Democratic campaigns outpace donations to Republican campaigns</b>. 
                    52% of WNBA owners donations went to Democrat-affiliated campaigns. For comparison, 23% of donations across leagues went to Democratic 
                    recipients. This is not incredibly shocking in light of <a href="https://justwomenssports.com/wnba-players-collective-activism-protests-black-lives-matter/">WNBA players' focus on social justice and activism</a>,
                    often regardless of public or owner opinion. Atlanta Dream co-owner and former US Senator Kelly Loeffler was quite active in her donations to Republican 
                    campaigns, including former President Trump's 2020 campaign. In defiance, Dream players demonstrated their support for her 2020 election opponent, 
                    Rev. Raphael Warnock. This trend of political engagement was echoed in the league owners' political donations. The WNBA is the only league
                    in which political donations did not significantly decrease between 2016 and 2020.

                    Interestingly, it was <b>men owners in the WNBA driving the leftward lean of the league's political donations</b>. Dissecting 
                    the WNBA numbers by gender, men owners' contributions comprise 68% of all donations from WNBA owners, and 72% of their political 
                    dollars went to Democratic campaigns. Of the 32% of WNBA donations that were made by women owners, nearly 90% went to Republican 
                    campaigns - the highest percentage of women owners' contributions to Republican campaigns of leagues that have women owners.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though a bit counter-intuitive, some might posit that men WNBA owners skewing the league's political dollars to the left is a parallel to 
                    the fanbase and marketing struggles experienced by the WNBA. The core focus of WNBA marketing in recent years has not been on getting more 
                    men to watch; the aim has been to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2018/04/20/adam-silver-one-of-the-wnbas-problems-is-that-not-enough-young-women-pay-attention-to-it/">
                    attract the attention of women</a>. The strategy seems to be working as <a href="https://www.wnba.com/news/wnba-delivers-most-watched-regular-season-in-14-years-and-shatters-fan-engagement-and-on-court-records/">
                    2022 was the most-watched regular season in 14 years</a>, and the league set records in "engagement across social media, digital, and merchandise."
                    As the league continues to grow and continues its political engagement both on and off the court, it will be interesting to see how owners' dollars 
                    will both shape and respond to the political landscape.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The bubble charts below summarize the donation patterns of men and women owners. The bubble represent the total donations to 
                    a particular party affiliation in each league, whereby size represents the donation amount and color represents the party affiliation of 
                    the donation. For example, the largest bubble in the first chart represents men MLB owners' donations to Republican-affiliated campaigns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Looking at men's donation patterns, the three largest donation amounts are MLB, NBA, and NHL owners' contributions to Republican affiliated
                    campaigns. Rounding out the top five are MLB and NBA donations to Democrat-affiliated campaigns.

                    Women's donations are overall much smaller than men's, but it is notable that women MLB owners' political contributions to
                    Democrat-affiliated campaigns represent the second-largest category of women's donations. And though women owners' donations are 
                    considerably smaller than men's in absolute value, in aggregation their ratio as owners is on par with their ratio of donated campaign dollars,
                    hovering at approximately 16% (25 women out of 158 owners) and 15% ($6.9 million out of $47 million), respectively.

                    Arguably, the NFL is the most visible example of women joining the playing field, literally and figuratively. In 2021, Sarah Thomas garnered attention 
                    as the <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/sarah-thomas-first-woman-to-referee-the-super-bowl">first woman referee to work a Super Bowl game</a>, 
                    having previously broken barriers as the first woman to referee a major college football game and college bowl game. In her 
                    pattern of firsts, she was first full-time woman hire in the NFL, and in 2019, she refereed an NFL playoff game. Also on the field in 
                    that historic 2021 Super Bowl were Tampa Bay Buccaneers assistant coaches Maral Javadifar and Lori Locust, the first women coaches on an 
                    NFL team to win a Super Bowl.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From a women's tackle football league to recruiting and sports broadcasting, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/indianapolis-colts-los-angeles-chargers-cleveland-browns-chicago-bears-nfl-3e631edfdc0a9ca3822cf6c9422bff11">women in the NFL are on the rise</a> 
                    and they are making their mark on the sport and the league. Half of the NFL fanbase is women, and this is nearly mirrored 
                    in the all-time high of 41.3% in the NFL's league office.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Women in the skybox owners suites are also getting a spotlight in the <a href="https://www.profootballhof.com/news/2019/08/female-nfl-team-owners-shed-light-on-history-in-film-a-lifetime-of-sundays/">film "A Lifetime of Sundays"</a>, which highlights the 
                    "the Founding Mothers" of the NFL and their contributions to the league. The idea to capture the stories of Virginia 
                    Halas McCaskey of the Chicago Bears, Patricia Rooney of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Norma Hunt of the Kansas City Chiefs,
                    and Martha Ford of the Detroit Lions was the brainchild of Jane Skinner Goodell, wife of NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell 
                    and a former television newscaster. As noted in USA Today, "The film reveals a slice of life rarely seen about an NFL owner, 
                    much less four of them. It also subtly tells the story of a generation of American women who, while never thinking of themselves 
                    as feminists or career women, became exactly that." And more than that, these women highlight the long history of women in the NFL.
                    While Thomas, Javadifar, and Locust made headlines with their roles in their first Super Bowls, Norma Hunt is living testament to 
                    the long-standing presence of women in the NFL. Quite literally, Hunt is the only owner - woman or man - to attend every Super Bowl game.
                    Perhaps it is a function of longevity, but women owners are also quite active in the political sphere. <b>The NFL is the only league 
                    wherein women owners' campaign donations outpace men's</b>.
                </p>

            <h3>Gender Breakdown of NFL Owners' Political Contributions</h3>
            <div id="legend-6"></div>

            <div>
                <p>
                    Of the owners included in FiveThirtyEight's dataset, nearly 16%, or 1 in 6 owners, are women. Encouragingly, 
                    the proportion of women owners is proportional to their political campaign donations, that is women owners account for 
                    just over 17% of political campaign donation in the dataset in aggregate. Breaking down these figures by league, however, 
                    we see that women owners in the NFL are relatively big political spenders. They make up 29% of owners in the NFL, yet they account for 
                    double that figure in terms of NFL political donations.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>Proportion of Women Owners Compared to Proportion of Women's Political Contributions by League</h3>
            <div id="legend-5"></div>
            <div id = "women-grouped-bar"></div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    The NFL is also the only league wherein the proportion women owner's political campaign contributions is outsized compared to 
                    their proportion as women owners. The MLB is the only league in which the proportions are the same; the most pronounced difference
                    in which women's donations are significantly less than their presence as team owners is in the NBA.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moreover, women owners in the WNBA and NFL are skewing the aggregate proportion of women sports team owners. Women account 
                    for 35% of owners in the WNBA and 29% in the NFL. On the other end of the spectrum are the MLB and NASCAR with 8% and 0% women owners, respectively. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Women's long-established, though long-unseen, role in the NFL could partially explain their activity in the political sphere. 
                    This outsized political acitvity is easier to explain compared to the break in patterns we see in the recipient affiliations of 
                    women MLB owners and men WNBA owners donations. In figuring out why these subgroups of sports team owners donate to Democratic campaigns requires 
                    more targeted research and analysis. The first step, nonetheless, is identifying these departures from the standard.

        <h2>Project Process</h2>
        <h3>Topic and Data Selection</h3>
            <p>
                My original idea for a topic was abortion, particularly abortion rights and access in various countries. However, there was 
                no readily available dataset. I could have pieced together various data points from articles and papers, but I wanted to spend 
                more time building charts in d3 rather than putting together a workable dataset. This led me to some of the links provided 
                for finding datasets, and I came across the data for political contributions of sports team owners. This piqued my interest 
                because of the close relationship between policy, politics, and business. Moreover, there were some interesting threads within 
                the data related to women vs men sports team owners. The data comes from FiveThirtyEight, 
                and more specifically this <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/sports-political-donations">GitHub 
                repository</a>.
            </p>
        <h3>Data Wrangling and Concerns</h3>
            <p>
                In my initial exploration of the data, I was surprised by the number of women owners I was seeing. I decided to create a 
                binary indicator, “Female”, with a value of 1 denoting if the owner was a woman or a woman was a co-owner in the cases of 
                shared controlling stakes in the team. In addition, I changed the string formatting of some variables, such as recipient 
                campaigns (Recipient) and forced some values, such as donation amount (Amount), to be integers. Lastly, I had to split the 
                data by league. Several owners in the dataset owned more than one team in  one or more leagues. Though I did not want to 
                double count donations in my overall, aggregate analysis. I did want a donation to count in all relevant spheres for any 
                analysis done by league. In other words, if an owner made political contributions and she/he had stakes in multiple leagues, 
                I wanted those political contributions to count in my analysis of the leagues in which he/she owned a team.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are a handful of records for which the party affiliation of the recipient is not specified, however I am not too 
                concerned by this, seeing as most records have a specified affiliation and the overwhelming majority of affiliations are either 
                Republican or Democratic. In dollar amounts, the donations with unspecified party affiliation of the recipient account for 
                only 3% of all donations. If the breakdown of affiliations was a bit more evenly split across all affiliation categories, 
                that would be more cause for concern.
            </p>
        <h3>Story Crafting</h3>
            <p>
                As mentioned above, I was intrigued by the number of women owners, and consequently wanted to know if their donation 
                patterns differed at all from men owners. Upon initial exploration of the data, I was a bit disappointed to find that, 
                looking at all leagues in aggregate, women owners behaved similarly to men in terms of the affiliation of their campaign 
                donations. Looking at all leagues, both men and women owners donate mostly to Republican-affiliated campaigns. Though 
                initially disappointed with this null finding, it makes sense. Big business interests often align with Republican platforms, 
                and gender of the owner would not necessarily play such a strong factor. Moreover, looking at all leagues, the proportion of 
                women owners was on par with the proportion of donations from women owners. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Not so much a pivot, but I did a deeper dive to see if these aggregate trends, I wanted to see if these patterns held in individual 
                leagues. This is when I found more interesting threads of the story to tease out and expand upon. Namely, 
                <ul>
                    <li>Women MLB owners and men NBA owners are the most Democratic in their campaign donations</li>
                    <li>WNBA is the only league in which donations to democrat-affiliated campaigns outnumber donations to republican-affiliated campaigns</li>
                    <li>NFL is the only league in which the proportion of women owners' donations outnumber men owners' political donations, 
                        despite women only making up 29% of owners in the NFL</li>
                  </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Figuring out why these anomalies occur is very much outside the scope of the dataset, but I tried to find contextual, 
                qualitative evidence to help explain the oddities in political donation patterns. The least well explained is women MLB 
                owners. The fanbase is not overwhelmingly liberal; the league commissioner donated to Republican campaigns. This indicates 
                they are not influenced from the bottom-up or the top-down. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The other mystery that remains is the extreme rightward lean of women WNBA owners and their men counterparts contrasting 
                leftward lean. The league overall was the most leftward leaning, and this could be explained, at least partially, by the 
                activism of players. But why men and women owners split this way is not readily explained.
            </p>
            <p>
                Upon further research, the long-standing presence of women in the NFL, especially at the ownership level, is a sound foundation 
                for women owners' outsized activity with their political dollars.
            </p>
        <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>
                I would like to note that I was not trying to only highlight women owners and/or the liberal anomalies in donation patterns. 
                The aim was to highlight any patterns that deviated from the aggregate trends, which includes men WNBA owners' contributions to Democratic campaigns
                and women WNBA owners' contributions to Republican-affiliated campaigns. To somewhat 
                address this concern, I wanted to present visualizations for the aggregate trends in the “Playing Field” sidebar and have 
                those contextual figures always readily available.
            </p>
        <h3>Chart Choices</h3>
            <p>
                Internally, I very much struggled with coming to terms with the fact that my data was not conducive to more complex charts. 
                In an attempt to demonstrate proficiency with more complex d3 charts, I created an alluvial chart (parallel-set.js  
                with data from sankey.csv). After I got most of the chart done and was going to fine tune the colors and formatting, I realized 
                that the chart was not  clear and not fitting for the point I was trying to make. I wanted to use the chart to highlight 
                women MLB owners' and men WNBA owners' contributions to Democrat-affiliated campaigns, but the alluvial chart very much hid those 
                findings. Largely because the absolute size of women MLB owners and men WNBA owners in dollar amounts was small compared to heavy 
                hitters, like men MLB and men NBA owners.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a similar vein, because most of the key parts of my story  were related to parts of a whole, I tried to utilize as many 
                chart types as possible that were appropriate for showing this kind of data. Yet, bar charts and donut charts were often the 
                most concise way of emphasizing my key points. I added some variety with the tree map and the bubble chart, as well as single 
                stacked bar charts as occasional substitutes for donut charts.
            </p>
        <h3>Coding Challenges</h3>
            <p>
                The main challenges I encountered were related to legends and needing to hard code my data arrays. I had incredible trouble using 
                d3-legend with the Legend and Swatches functions, so I ultimately hard coded my legends. This was redundant and a bit clunky. 
                Though I am pleased with how the legends turned out, I would have liked to streamline that code more. Related to this is the 
                hard coding the arrays I created for some of the charts. Though for a couple charts I demonstrated a general grasp 
                of data manipulation and array/object creation with JavaScript functions, it was a time-consuming process with which I need to get more 
                comfortable. Additionally, with more time, I would have liked to have refined the layout with CSS and refined the layout 
                of the side-by-side bubble charts. Specifically, figuring out the d3.forceX function would have added a nice element to the bubble charts, with the bubbles on a political, left-right spectrum.
