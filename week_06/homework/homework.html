    <h1>Simple Breakdown</h1>
    <p>There were several indicator variables in the dataset, so I thought it would be appropriate to visualize those variables with donut charts.
        The donut chart regarding gender of the police shooting victim is not all that surpising or unintiuitive; 
        however, the other two regarding the fleeing the scene and having a mental illness are a bit more interesting. 
        If victims of police shootings are not fleeing the scene, it makes one wonder why fatal use of force. This could suggest that 
        alternatives to force, such as de-escalation techniques, might be useful in some situations. The final donut chart, regarding
        known history of mental illness, is a tad contrary to popular narratives surrounding fatal encounters with police. Less than a quarter of victims 
        in fatal police shootings had a known mental illness.

        <h1>Fatal Police Shootings by Month</h1>
        <p>The following line charts shows how the number of fatal police shootings changed over the course of 2015.
        </p>
        <p>
            It could have been interesting to show changes in the months in various regions using a multi-line chart or a dropdown menu,
            but I wasn't sure there would be enough variation to find anything interesting. In the end I decided on a single line chart and annotations to point out
            interesting peaks and valleys.

    <div class="container"></div>
        <h1>Race & Police Shootings</h1>
        <p>The following  bar chart shows how the number of fatal police shootings in each of region of the US, 
            as defined by the <a href="https://data.oecd.org/interest/long-term-interest-rates.htm#indicator-charthttps://www.businessinsider.com/regions-of-united-states-2018-5#the-bureau-of-economic-analysis-goes-with-this-eight-region-map-of-the-us-its-regions-are-new-england-the-mideast-the-southeast-the-great-lakes-the-plains-the-southwest-the-rocky-mountains-and-the-far-west-9">Bureau of Economic Analysis</a>.
            The regions are further broken down by race of the shooting victim. Granted this data is from 2015, 
            but it is a bit surprising to see that the race with the most (absolute) victims of police shootings are white, 
            followed by Black (Great Lakes, Southeast, Mideast, and Plains) and Asian (Farwest, Southwest, and Rockies) victims.
        </p>  
        <p>
            This calls into question sensationalized headlines about police targeting of minorities. According to data from 2015,
            there is no systemic pattern of police targeting racial minorities. Notably, more recent data may be more consistent with 
            recent narratives of police targeting. A broader analysis of change over time could be interesting for further analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
            I chose a stacked bar chart to represent this data to show how race categories comprise total numbers of police shooting victims in various regions.
            The stacked bar chart is good at showing, parts of a whole, and the regional separation shows how the proportion of victims based on race 
            differ throughout various regions.  For example, Asian victims in the Farwest, Southwest, and Rockies might have been lost using a broader national scope.
            I think I'm right on the edge of having too many categories for a stacked bar chart; a tree map for each region could have been intersting as well.
            I chose regions over states because including all states would have been too overwhelming and probably not all that informative.
            Regions are more digestable categorization for my purposes here.
